## Large Language Model
- Trained on massing amounts of text data to learn patterns and entity relationships in the language. 
- Use deep learning algorithms to process, understand natural language, performing tasks such as
  - Search
  - Classify
  - Generate
  - Summarize
  - Rewrite
  - Extract

## Langchain
- Open source
- Lego block for LLMs
- Multiple models for various behaviors without having to learn from scratch
- Create pipelines using langchain to speed up development
